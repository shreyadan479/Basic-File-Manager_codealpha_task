# Basic-File-Manager_codealpha_task

This project used C++ file handling to navigate directories, examine files, create directories, and copy or move files. It was an excellent opportunity to expand my knowledge of the'std::filesystem' library and improve my programming abilities. I look forward to more tough tasks!
